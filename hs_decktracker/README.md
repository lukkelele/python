# Deck Tracker 
## Lukas Gunnarsson, 2022

I played lots of Hearthstone in 2015-2016 and early on I had a notebook in which I wrote what the enemy had played to keep track of possible threats.  
This approach was obviously not effecient and a while later when it was stated that deck trackers did *NOT* break the TOS, I began using one.  
\\
I began playing again and it has been rough getting used to all the new cards and the game pace.  
The idea of merging a deck tracker with some sort of program to check for big drops and win conditions based on which class I faced came to my mind.
