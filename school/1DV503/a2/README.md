My personal life has been quite busy and I've not managed to finish in time.\\
The diagram has to be adjusted with the appropriate relationships.\\
When reading the data from the *csv files*, currently there is no way of properly getting the initial data into separate tables. An example is with Planet and Environment, the multivalued attribute *climate* from Planet is to be moved to a separate entity to reduce redundancy. When parsing the data, the entire column could instantly be assigned to Environment and then later referenced. I am to implement something along those lines. \\
I will finish the assignment as soon as possible and have a proper report ready to hand in.\\
