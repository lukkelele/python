# Simple informational *menu* for my sister who plays sims

---
It is basically a print machine. No webscraping for new information, just prints random sims cheats.  
I'd love to implement a full modmenu which would execute the different tasks for each cheat by just selecting it.  
BUT, I have lots to do in school, so it could be something that I'll do in the future for fun.
